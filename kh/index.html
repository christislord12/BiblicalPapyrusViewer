<P>
The Ketef Hinnom Silver Scrolls are an archeological artifact that dates back to the First Temple Period and contain the earliest inscription containing text from the Hebrew Bible.  This is an informational website created by some archeology fanatic who is really interested in the Ketef Hinnom Silver Scrolls and has absolutely no formal archeological or theological education!  Use the links to navigate. FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD IN THIS WAY; HE GAVE HIS ONE AND ONLY SON, SO THAT EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT PERISH BUT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.
